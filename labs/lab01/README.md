# Lab 01 - Where Are the Seams?

Review the current monolithic architecture described at https://github.com/KernelGamut32/intermediate-api-dev-public/blob/main/labs/lab01/Monolith%20Design.pdf. You have been tasked with rearchitecting this application and converting it from a monolith to a system of microservice APIs. In a breakout room, discuss the following:

* For the operations to be supported, what are the expected inputs and expected outputs?
* How would you divide this monolith into a system of microservices? What would each microservice do and how would it need to integrate with others?
* How would you secure your system of microservices?
* How would you test your system of microservices?

In your breakout rooms, feel free to leverage diagramming tools to sketch out details about your microservices and their interaction.
